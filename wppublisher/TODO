If you would like to tackle any of these (that's great!), please let me know and I'll be sure to help.

New Features
------------

    - Add support for providers other than Digital Ocean (e.g. AWS, Bytemark Cloud Servers, Linode).

    - Add SSL support along with letsencrypt SSL as default.

    - Add wordmove support. This is a case of generating and adding wordmove when installing a new site.

    - Add cli support (see Appendix B)


Clean up/Tweaks
---------------

    - Make spin up on digital ocean smarter. Currently it can spit out a lot of rubbish before it gets started properly
     (see appendix A).

    - Display more on the log tab. Currently quite a lot is echoed out to the log but not the gui.

    - Clean up the WpConfig class. It's far too complicated for what it does.


Setting up ssh keys
-------------------

* First install puttygen and pageant
* generate a key
* save them both somewhere e.g. c:\ssh_keys
* add the private key to pageant
* Add the public key to wp-publisher

Appendix B


Creating a new installation
---------------------------

	wp-publisher create --username t5_admin --url t5.test.lan

This is if you start a completely new project and want to get started. This wraps around two other key tools, wp-cli and wordmove (both of which should be available globally).

The steps:
	- create a new folder in public_html


Provision a installation
------------------------

This populates a new server

	wp-publisher provision --local-url t5.test.lan --remote-url t5.co.uk


Delete a local copy
-------------------

For safety reasons, this just deletes the local copy of the database, files and nginx config. Log in to the VPS provider to delete the production copy which is usually a case of deleting the whole vps.

	wp-publisher delete --local-url t5.test.lan
